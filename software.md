# Battleship! with 4 different kinds of AI

> insert images

This was my final project for one of my programming classes at CMU. It is like any game of battleship you've ever played, but as a twist, I've created 4 distinct variants of AI that you can play against. You may create your own games with a custom-sized grid and use your keyboard to place your ships. The project was created purely in Python with a modified version of Tkinter. The reason why I chose this specific project is that it presented a unique challenge. Many have heard of chess AI or even Monopoly AI, but far few have tried to create a Battleship AI. The main reason is due to the lack of "strategy" in the game, but I gave it a shot. The two hardest difficulties include the Monte Carlo Method to estimate the possible outcomes of the uncertain positions of ships and a version of Machine Learning which takes your previous games and finds a pattern.
