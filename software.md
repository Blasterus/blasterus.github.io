# ARENA MyCobot Implementation (ongoing)

![Arena](/assets/IMG_0439.jpg)

For my latest ongoing project, working at the WiSELab at CMU, I developed a control system for two robot arms - MyCobot 280 and MyCobot 320. It was done within an exciting AR and VR environment called ARENA XR. With this system, users can manipulate the robot arms with ease, gaining full control over their movements and actions. The dynamic AR and VR interface provides a truly immersive experience that allows users to interact with the robot arms in a way that feels intuitive and engaging. The rig also includes web cameras and joysticks, so that the controls can be truly “remote”. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Blasterus/SteveLu-ARENA-py-Scripts).


# Battleship! with 4 different kinds of AI

This was my final project for one of my programming classes at CMU. It is like any game of battleship you've ever played, but as a twist, I've created 4 distinct variants of AI that you can play against. You may create your own games with a custom-sized grid and use your keyboard to place your ships. The project was created purely in Python with a modified version of Tkinter. The reason why I chose this specific project is that it presented a unique challenge. Many have heard of chess AI or even Monopoly AI, but far few have tried to create a Battleship AI. The main reason is due to the lack of "strategy" in the game, but I gave it a shot. The two hardest difficulties include the Monte Carlo Method to estimate the possible outcomes of the uncertain positions of ships and a version of Machine Learning which takes your previous games and finds a pattern.
