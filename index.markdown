Hi there!

I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. My passions include AR/VR, robotics, and game development. I love Edgar Wright movies. My resume can be found [here]({{blasterus.github.io}}/assets/resume.pdf).

My software projects can be found [here]({{ blasterus.github.io }}{% software.md %}) and my design projects can be found [here]({{ blasterus.github.io }}{% design.md %}).
