# Panarctica

Panarctica is a vertical slice and proof of concept of a first-person shooter set in an ice age with zeppelins. It shows how a typical mission will look if the player pursues the piracy character arc. 300 years from now, the surface of Earth is a frozen wasteland. You play as Lefty, a pirate aboard an airship called The Campbell. If you want to read more about the game development process click [here](https://komarmatthewl.medium.com/panarctica-cb283d79188b).

# Blueprint 

Blueprint is a temporary name for an ambitious project. This was the main design work I did for GNF Unlimited Inc., a tech PR firm. The purpose of this website was to adapt the online freelancer model to UI and UX designers. Clients would see our past portfolios and commission a designer to create a website or application. They would be able to communicate with the designer every step of the way and be updated with every change and choice. What is shown here are designs for the website that is currently being developed. While I did not come up with the idea of the website itself, the actual designs are mine. I worked with a small team of three people, and I communicated with each often in order to keep track of progress. Throughout this experience, not only did I hone my collaboration skills, I learned how to use Figma and how to work in a professional environment

# Minion

Minion is a subversion of the roguelike genre. Instead of playing as the main protagonist fighting against evil, you play as a lackey of an evil necromancer. I served as the project's lead game designer. I created several level themes, adversaries, weapons, and other game-related items. I completed extensive statistical analysis for the items and the skill tree. I documented all of this in Github and Google Suites so others can have access to it and collaborate together. In addition, after deciding on design options, I collaborated with musicians, artists, and software engineers to put gaming concepts into practice and develop an immersive experience for the player.

# Empyrean 

Empyrean is a steampunk first-person shooter with a heavy emphasis on moment-to-moment gameplay and movement mechanics. I was in charge of the game vision, every game mechanic, every weapon, and the overall map that the player would interact with. I made key decisions early in the development process in order to maximize the fun for the player, learning from the top FPS games of our time. Design pillars were set and I created extensive spreadsheets in order to compare weapon balance numbers across various games that I researched, including TF2 and Overwatch. I worked with my team lead, artists and programmers extensively to make sure they understood what my vision was. Final version [here](https://github.com/amyxlase/Project-Sapphire).
