# Blackmailer's Deck

Backmailer’s Deck is a fast-paced bluffing and deduction game for 3 players based on Liar's Deck. Each player plays a mix of real and fake cards to survive—lose all your tokens and you're out. The last player standing wins. It draws inspiration from games like Coup and Skull, but focuses more on short-term memory, risk-taking, and reverse psychology.

The twist? Blackmail cards. They punish failed challenges and can restore tokens, flipping the power dynamic mid-round. The game creates tension with minimal rules and maximum social pressure.

I designed this in a game design course focused on creating analog games with strong player interaction. I worked on refining the bluffing mechanics, balancing the Blackmail card effect, and ensuring the ruleset stayed simple but led to interesting decision-making. We playtested multiple rounds to tweak card counts, rule timing, and improve pacing.


# A Gentleman's Dispute

A Gentlemen’s Dispute is a 1v1v1v1 duelling game where two Victorian gentlemen settle their differences using hats, slaps, teacups, and flair. It’s a local and online multiplayer comedy fighter with a one-button control scheme that still allows for surprisingly strategic mind games.

This game was designed to be instantly readable, fast-paced, and ridiculous—perfect for short chaotic sessions between friends. I worked on tuning the core combat feel: hit timings and the pacing of rounds. I also helped shape the visual and thematic cohesion, ensuring the game's slapstick violence matched its high-society satire.

We kept the input simple and the mechanics tight so the humor could shine through the gameplay itself. The result is a highly replayable, charmingly unhinged little game that always gets a laugh. [Website](https://www.blastfurnacegames.com/)


# Harbingers

Harbingers is an FPS MMO that is a unique combination of mechanics that we feel is missing from the rapidly growing space of PvPvE experiences (think: Escape From Tarkov, Dark and Darker, The Cycle: Frontier, Destiny). In Harbingers, the entire player base is pitted against a single adversary: Earth itself, which has been converted into an endless factory by a rogue AI. It is set far in the future where an exiled humanity launches near-suicidal strike missions from the moon to reclaim territory and extract resources from a long dead earth consumed by technology. This game project went through several genre changes throughout its 1 year in development, and I’ve helped shape and mould it to the way that it plays today. Some gameplay screenshots are also shown above. [Website](https://www.blastfurnacegames.com/)


# Salvage Wars

This was a unique game created in my TTRPG game design class. We were taught all different types of TTRPGs and the styles that players tend to lean towards, including realism and gameism. For my final, I decided to design and polish a very simple yet creative type of TTRPG. It is a combat based game, but instead of dice, you use coins to decide your fate. They also represent your total health. Every player pilots a mech and tries to be the last one standing.

# Panarctica

Panarctica is a vertical slice and proof of concept of a first-person shooter set in an ice age with zeppelins. It shows how a typical mission will look if the player pursues the piracy character arc. 300 years from now, the surface of Earth is a frozen wasteland. You play as Lefty, a pirate aboard an airship called The Campbell. If you want to read more about the game development process click [here](https://komarmatthewl.medium.com/panarctica-cb283d79188b).

# Blueprint 

![Blueprint](/assets/blueprint.webp)

Blueprint is a temporary name for an ambitious project. This was the main design work I did for GNF Unlimited Inc., a tech PR firm. The purpose of this website was to adapt the online freelancer model to UI and UX designers. Clients would see our past portfolios and commission a designer to create a website or application. They would be able to communicate with the designer every step of the way and be updated with every change and choice. What is shown here are designs for the website that is currently being developed. While I did not come up with the idea of the website itself, the actual designs are mine. I worked with a small team of three people, and I communicated with each often in order to keep track of progress. Throughout this experience, not only did I hone my collaboration skills, I learned how to use Figma and how to work in a professional environment

# Minion

Minion is a subversion of the roguelike genre. Instead of playing as the main protagonist fighting against evil, you play as a lackey of an evil necromancer. I served as the project's lead game designer. I created several level themes, adversaries, weapons, and other game-related items. I completed extensive statistical analysis for the items and the skill tree. I documented all of this in Github and Google Suites so others can have access to it and collaborate together. In addition, after deciding on design options, I collaborated with musicians, artists, and software engineers to put gaming concepts into practice and develop an immersive experience for the player.

# Empyrean 

![Empyrean](/assets/empyrean.webp)

Empyrean is a steampunk first-person shooter with a heavy emphasis on moment-to-moment gameplay and movement mechanics. I was in charge of the game vision, every game mechanic, every weapon, and the overall map that the player would interact with. I made key decisions early in the development process in order to maximize the fun for the player, learning from the top FPS games of our time. Design pillars were set and I created extensive spreadsheets in order to compare weapon balance numbers across various games that I researched, including TF2 and Overwatch. I worked with my team lead, artists and programmers extensively to make sure they understood what my vision was. Final version [here](https://github.com/amyxlase/Project-Sapphire).
